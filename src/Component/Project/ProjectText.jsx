        As a UI/UX and Graphics Designer, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of creative
        projects focused on crafting intuitive user experiences and visually
        compelling designs. From wireframing and prototyping to brand identity
        and digital illustrations, my work reflects a balance of functionality
        and aesthetic appeal.
